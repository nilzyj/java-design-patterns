## 又称
Wrapper

## Intent
Convert the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that 
couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
将一个类的接口转换为客户端期望的另一个接口。适配器让那些因为接口不兼容而无法工作的类一起工作。

## 解释

真实世界的例子

> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another

简单来说

> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

维基百科说

> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

**程序实例**

设想一个只能使用划艇而根本不能航行的船长。

首先，我们有两个接口：`RowingBoat` 和 `FishingBoat`。

```java
public interface RowingBoat {
  void row();
}

public class FishingBoat {
  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoat.class);
  public void sail() {
    LOGGER.info("The fishing boat is sailing");
  }
}
```

而船长希望 `RowingBoat` 接口的实现能够移动

```java
public class Captain {

  private final RowingBoat rowingBoat;
  // default constructor and setter for rowingBoat
  public Captain(RowingBoat rowingBoat) {
    this.rowingBoat = rowingBoat;
  }

  public void row() {
    rowingBoat.row();
  }
}
```

现在我们假设海盗来了，我们的船长需要逃跑，但是只有渔船可用。我们需要创建一个适配器，让船长用他的划船技术来操作渔船。

```java
public class FishingBoatAdapter implements RowingBoat {

  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoatAdapter.class);

  private final FishingBoat boat;

  public FishingBoatAdapter() {
    boat = new FishingBoat();
  }

  @Override
  public void row() {
    boat.sail();
  }
}
```

现在 `Captain` 可以用 `FishingBoat` 逃离海盗

```java
var captain = new Captain(new FishingBoatAdapter());
captain.row();
```

## 适用性
在以下情况下使用适配器模式

* 你想使用一个现有的类，而它的接口与你需要的不匹配
* you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces
* you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
* most of the applications using third party libraries use adapters as a middle layer between the application and the 3rd party library to decouple the application from the library. If another library has to be used only an adapter for the new library is required without having to change the application code.

## Consequences:
Class and object adapters have different trade-offs. A class adapter

*	adapts Adaptee to Target by committing to a concrete Adaptee class. As a consequence, a class adapter won’t work when we want to adapt a class and all its subclasses.
*	let’s Adapter override some of Adaptee’s behavior, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee.
*	introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee.

An object adapter	

*	let’s a single Adapter work with many Adaptees—that is, the Adaptee itself and all of its subclasses (if any). The Adapter can also add functionality to all Adaptees at once.
*	makes it harder to override Adaptee behavior. It will require subclassing Adaptee and making Adapter refer to the subclass rather than the Adaptee itself.
